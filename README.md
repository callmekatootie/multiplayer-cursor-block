# Multiplayer Cursor Block

A PoC [Github Block](https://blocks.githubnext.com/) to demonstrate how users can collaborate on a repository by sharing their mouse cursors with other users viewing the same file.

**NOTE**

This block uses the [Starter plan of liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/pricing) which restricts the number of users using it to 100MAUs. It is advised that you clone it and replace the public api key under `blocks/liveblocks.config.ts` file with your liveblocks key
